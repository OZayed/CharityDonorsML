# CharityDonorsML

This is a machine learning prjocet on a charity donors data, where i went through the entier pipeline of machine learning
starting from data cleaning and preprocessing, to selecting models, and explaining how they work and comparing them
then chosing the best model (RandomForest) and then optimizing that for the best results
and delivering these results in different comparisions in layman terms for non-technical personal 

all details are in the jupyter notebook, hope it is helpful.
